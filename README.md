# DesignSystem

In large development teams, maintaining consistency across user interfaces can be a daunting challenge. With developers utilizing varying measurements, styles, colors, and UI elements, the result is often a chaotic and disjointed user experience.

This is an idea for design system which provides a centralized repository of predefined components, styles, and UI elements. By establishing a set of standardized guidelines and best practices, developers can easily access and implement consistent UI components, ensuring uniformity across all applications.

With the Design System Module, developers no longer need to reinvent the wheel with each UI component. Instead, they can leverage a comprehensive collection of pre-designed elements, including buttons, lists, forms, and more. This not only streamlines the development process but also guarantees a cohesive and polished user interface.

Say goodbye to version discrepancies and inconsistencies in UI components. With the Design System Module, your development team can work efficiently and collaboratively, delivering exceptional user experiences with ease.

We can also directly generate core files .swift/.kt from the Figma directly and push it our repo.But thats next adventure.
